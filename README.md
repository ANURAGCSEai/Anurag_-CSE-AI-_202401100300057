This project implements the classic game of Noughts and Crosses (also known as Tic-Tac-Toe) in Python, where a human player (Player O) plays against an AI (Player X). The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make optimal moves, ensuring that it plays perfectly against the human player.
